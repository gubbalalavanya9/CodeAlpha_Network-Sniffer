## NetSentinel – Basic Network Sniffer

## CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship Task 1

## Overview
NetSentinel is a Python-based network packet analysis tool that demonstrates core packet sniffing concepts using **offline PCAP analysis**. The project follows ethical cybersecurity practices by avoiding live traffic capture.
## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scapy
- PCAP file analysis
## Features
- Offline packet inspection
- IP, port, and protocol analysis
- Rule-based threat scoring
- Automatic security report generation
## How It Works
1. Loads a pre-captured PCAP file
2. Extracts packet metadata (IP, ports, protocols)
3. Applies heuristic rules to detect suspicious behavior
4. Generates alerts and a security report
## Sample Output
Total packets loaded: 100
Security report generated successfully.
## Ethics & Safety
- No live network sniffing
- Uses publicly available sample PCAP files
- Safe for academic and learning environments
